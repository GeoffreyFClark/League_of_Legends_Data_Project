Note placeholders for the RiotGames API Key and Discord Bot Token.

# League_of_Legends_Data_Project
Queries the RiotGames API to retrieve Data. Implemented a Discord bot for user interaction.
Focuses on player data from recent games along with general info such as current rank.

TODO:

- I'd like to add Live Match Data, so the bot can be used as a tool for analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and habits of teammates + opponents during load screen.

- I'm also planning to add web-scraped data that isn't available in the RiotGames API.

- Add database to save information that can be analyzed for trends etc.
