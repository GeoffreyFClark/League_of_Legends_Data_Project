Placeholders for the RiotGames API Key and Discord Bot Token.

# League_of_Legends_Data_Project
Queries the RiotGames API to retrieve Data. Implemented a Discord bot for user interaction.
Focuses on Match History Data from recent games (limited to 5 games as Discord has a 2000 character per message limit)

TODO:
I'd like to add Live Match Data, so the bot can be used as a tool for analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and habits of teammates + opponents during load screen.
I'm also planning to add web-scraped data that isn't available in the RiotGames API along with a databasae that can allow data analysis of player-specific trends.
