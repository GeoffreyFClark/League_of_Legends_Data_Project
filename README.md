Placeholders for the RiotGames API Key and Discord Bot Token in this upload.

# League_of_Legends_Data_Project
Queries the RiotGames API to retrieve Data. Implemented a Discord bot for user interaction.
Focuses on Match History Data from recent games.

TODO:

- I'd like to add Live Match Data, so the bot can be used as a tool for analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and habits of teammates + opponents during load screen.

- I'm also planning to add web-scraped data that isn't available in the RiotGames API.

- Add databasae to save information that can be analyzed for trends etc.
